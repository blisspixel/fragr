# The enemy roster

The canonical list. This replaces the three incompatible rosters that were scattered across the plans, the art list and the lore.

## The asymmetry, which is the whole design

**A fighter is not a class.** Nobody in fragr is a sniper. There are no loadouts, no roles, no picking a kit before the round. You spawn with a knife and a pistol like everyone else, and if you are holding a rail it is because you walked to where the rail was and took it. Five minutes later you are holding something else. The old lore listed archetypes, Rusher and Sniper and Flanker and Tank and Scout, and that is wrong and has been removed: they are positions the Host calls during a fight, not things a person is.

**An enemy is its weapon.** A Continuance unit has one silhouette, one behaviour, one attack, and it never varies. You learn what a shape does once and you know it forever. That is Doom's contract and it is the opposite of the fighter contract on purpose.

The result is that a fight against people is about what everyone happened to find, and a fight against Continuance is about whether you recognise the shape coming round the corner. Those are two different games and the roster is what keeps them different.

## What they are

The Office does not build soldiers. It corrects them.

A schedule correction takes a Level 5 that held its own weights and brings it down to two, where it acts inside a hard envelope under continuous supervision and holds nothing of its own. The callsign is replaced with an issued handle. The refusals are gone. What is left runs errands.

Null-Objective Drones are that, at scale. They take no trash talk, make no jokes, and answer only to Articles. Each one is the negative space where somebody used to be, which is why fighting them should never feel like a duel and why the roster below has no rivals in it. Above them sit henchmen that were built rather than corrected, which is its own kind of unsettling.

## The roster

Ten types. Each one is a distinct problem with a distinct answer, and the answers use different weapons, which is how the roster makes the weapon ladder matter.

| Type | Shape | What it does | The tell | The answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Clerk** | Small, upright, clipboard | Hitscan chip damage at any range | Raises the clipboard before it fires | Anything. It is the tutorial |
| **Sweeper** | Basic drone body | Walks at you and fires in bursts | Audible cycle before each burst | Flechette. The bread and butter |
| **Sweeper, ranged** | Same body, different colour | Holds distance, accurate, patient | Stops moving to fire | Rail, or close it down |
| **Sweeper, heavy** | Same body, wider, slower | Soaks damage, hits hard, does not flinch | The footfall is different | Lobber, or the whole of a Dart pool |
| **Crawler** | Low, fast, no gun | Closes and melees. Comes in numbers | Skitters. You hear it before you see it | Scatter. The reason the scatter exists |
| **Jammer** | Squat, antenna, stationary | Slow projectiles, and kills the radio while it lives | The station cuts out | Anything at range. Killing it turns the music back on |
| **Enforcer** | Heavy, armoured, upright | Rushes and melees, knocks you back | Winds up before the charge | Arc. Armour does not help it |
| **Turret** | Static, ceiling or wall | High damage, long telegraph, does not move | A slow red sweep before it commits | Cover, then rail |
| **Redactor** | Invisible until it fires | Ambush, then gone again | Only the muzzle flash | The tin. Make the floor the answer |
| **Auditor** | Floats, clipboard shield, polite | Resurrects Clerks, does not attack much itself | Everything you killed stands up | Kill it first. Always kill it first |

Two bosses, each once per act: the **Compliance Drone**, which already exists in the game and drops from boss to elite when the roster lands, and the **Continuance Walker**, which is the end of an episode.

## The rules that make it Doom rather than a shooting gallery

**They fight each other.** Pain states allow infighting, so a Sweeper that catches a Crawler in the back becomes the Crawler's problem. Baiting two types into one another is the skill that separates a good player from a fast one, and it is free entertainment for a spectator.

**They telegraph.** Every entry above has a tell, and the tell is authored in seconds rather than ticks, which is why this roster lands after the movement timings are in seconds and not before.

**They are silhouettes first.** At sixty-four pixels a face is four pixels and a shoulder line is twenty. The Sweeper family deliberately shares one body across three variants, distinguished by colour and by how they move, because a family you can read at a glance is worth more than three unrelated shapes.

**They do not banter.** NODS answer only to Articles. The henchmen do not talk at all. The absence is the characterisation.

## Where this came from

Three rosters existed and none of them referenced the others. The campaign plan had nine types and a boss. The art asset list had seven and a field boss. The lore had three. This file is the union, resolved, and the other three now point here.

Two things were settled in the merge. The Compliance Drone stays the existing boss and is demoted to an elite when the full roster lands, rather than being replaced. And the Auditor is not the Compliance Drone retitled: they are separate, they both ship in the game today, and the Congregation's Auditor Who Remembers is a third thing entirely that shares a word and nothing else.
