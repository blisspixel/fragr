# Plan: gunfeel and aim

**Status:** in flight (aim defaults, weapon table, and real dispersion shipped 2026-09-19)
**Branch:** `feat/gunfeel-*`
**Spend:** $0.

## Goal

Make shooting and aiming feel like the games that got it right, with numbers taken from their sources rather than from taste, and with the parameters in one place so the playtest harness and the QA tour can sweep them. This plan carries the research of 2026-09-18 and the starting parameter set it produced. Movement plumbing lives in `buttery-controls.md`; this plan owns what the weapons and the aim do once the plumbing is honest.

Unit note: one fragr unit is one metre. Classic values are converted at one Quake or Hammer unit equals one inch, which is the common convention and not a claim from id or Valve.

## What a firing frame actually shows (2026-09-19)

The visual QA tour could not answer anything about effects, because a muzzle flash lasts sixty to a hundred milliseconds and a still taken at a fixed second almost never lands inside one. The tour now has states that pull the trigger and keep eight consecutive frames as a strip, so the flash, the tracer and the impact can be looked at rather than guessed at.

The first strips say three things.

- **First person has no muzzle flash at all.** The flash is a sprite on the fighter's pawn, and in first person the pawn is not what the player is looking at. Eight frames from the trigger show the view model, the crosshair, and nothing else changing. The only feedback a player gets for their own shot is the sound and, on a hit, the hit marker.
- **Third person has one.** The same trigger pull watched from the follow camera shows an orange flash beside the fighter, so the effect exists and is wired; it is the first-person view that is missing it.
- **Nothing marks where the shot landed.** No tracer along the line, no impact on the wall, no spark on the fighter. A shot that hits and a shot that misses look the same in the world.

That last one matters more than it sounds. The agents needed `MapInfo` before they could tell a wall from a target; a player has the same problem in reverse, with no way to see where a miss went and so no way to correct.

The order to fix them is first-person flash, then impact on the surface, then a tracer for the rail, because that is the order a player notices them.

## Two defects the research found in the current code

1. **The default mouse sensitivity is about six times Counter-Strike's.** The client turns 0.003 radians per mouse count, which is 0.172 degrees per count, or 6.6 centimetres per 360 degrees at 800 counts per inch. Counter-Strike 2 ships 0.022 degrees per count at sensitivity 1.25, which is 41.6 centimetres per 360. Competitive players usually sit between 30 and 50. A player cannot aim at six times their muscle memory, and no amount of netcode fixes it. **Shipped:** the client now uses the Source convention, 0.022 degrees per count with a default sensitivity of 1.5, giving 34.7 centimetres per 360 at 800 counts per inch, and the setting is stored in those units so a player can paste a number from another game.

2. **What the code calls weapon "spread" is deterministic aim forgiveness, not dispersion.** `check_hitscan` accepts a target when the angle to it is inside the spread cone and the perpendicular distance is inside two player radii. Every shot inside the cone hits. Rail's 0.04 radians is 2.3 degrees of free aim error, which is console-grade bullet magnetism handed to a mouse; Quake 3's rail has none, and Halo 4's assault rifle bullet magnetism is 3 degrees. The fix is to separate the two ideas: a random dispersion inside a cone (which a player learns to manage) from an aim-assist cone (which only a gamepad gets, and smaller).

## The parameter set

Every number has a reason and a source or an explicit "ours to tune". Damage is per shot, intervals in seconds, cones in radians, ranges in units.

| Parameter | Today | Target | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top speed | 5.0 | 6.5 | Between Counter-Strike's rifle speed (5.46) and Quake 3's (8.13). Crossing the 50 unit arena drops from 10 s to 7.7 s. |
| Acceleration time constant | 0.06 | 0.06 | Ninety-five percent of top speed in 0.18 s, near Quake 3's 0.157 s. Keep. |
| Deceleration time constant | 0.04 | 0.09 | Stop distance 0.20 to 0.59 units; Counter-Strike's is 0.85. Stopping becomes a commitment, which is what gives a movement penalty teeth. |
| Jump or dodge | neither | ground dodge: 2.0x top speed for 0.20 s, 1.2 s cooldown, double tap within 0.25 s, then 0.35x speed clamp for 0.3 s | Unreal Tournament's dodge is 1.5x with a hard landing penalty. A dodge stays in two dimensions: no gravity, no ground state, no three-dimensional hit test, one input bit and one cooldown field on the wire. A jump costs all of that and desynchronises prediction on landing. |
| Flechette | 25 / 0.50 s / 0.10 / 42 | 25 / 0.20 s / 0.045 standing, 0.018 moving / 40 / no falloff / 0.25 s switch | Four shots in 0.60 s bare, 1.4 s through armour. Halving the cone moves "aim matters" from beyond 10 units to beyond 22. |
| Rail | 75 / 2.00 s / 0.04 / 100 | 80 / 1.00 s / 0.012 standing, 0.004 moving / 60 / no falloff / 0.35 s switch | Two shots in 1.0 s mirrors Quake 3's rail (100 damage, 1.5 s). 0.012 radians is 0.7 degrees, near Quake 3's zero-spread rail. Range 60 fits a 50 unit arena. |
| Scatter | 15 / 0.25 s / 0.38 / 14 | 40 / 0.45 s / 0.20 standing, 0.12 moving / 12 / full damage to 4 units then linear to 0.35x at 12 / 0.20 s switch | Three shots point blank in 0.90 s, eight at the edge. Banded falloff follows Titanfall 2 and Counter-Strike. |
| Movement inaccuracy | none | cone multiplied by a lerp from 1.0 to 0.40 with speed over top speed, recovering with a 0.10 s time constant, no penalty below 30 percent of top speed | Counter-Strike's penalty is a pure function of current speed and is zero below 34 percent of the weapon's own maximum. New mechanic. |
| Time to kill | 1.5 to 3.5 s | 0.6 to 1.2 s bare, under 1.8 s through full armour | Counter-Strike's rifle is 0.20 to 0.30 s, Valorant's 0.21, and a modern shooter benchmark is 0.2 to 0.3 s close quarters. fragr is Quake-slow in a Counter-Strike-sized arena with no vertical escape, which is the worst of both. |
| Hit zones | none | none | Quake 3 and Doom both apply a scalar with no hit location; Unreal Tournament gives headshots only to its sniper. Uniform damage also keeps the two-dimensional hit test honest. |
| Hit marker | none | 120 ms marker with a 40 ms audio tick; 250 ms on a kill | Sized against Quake 3's 200 ms pain twitch. Ours to tune. |
| Muzzle flash | none | 20 to 30 ms | Quake 3 uses 20 ms. A pop, not a glow. |
| View kick | none | 0.8 degrees flechette, 2.5 degrees rail, in over 100 ms and out over 400 ms | Quake 3's damage kick uses exactly those two times. |
| Screen shake | none | rotation only, peak 1.0 degree, squared decay over 200 ms | Quake 3's run roll peaks near 1.6 degrees; staying under 2 avoids nausea. Ours to tune. |
| View bob | none | 0.04 units vertical, 0.6 degrees pitch and roll, about 1.8 Hz at top speed | Quake 3's bob is 1.6 units vertical and 0.002 radians of pitch. Bob is much smaller than it feels. |
| Crosshair | fixed | static inner pip plus a detached outer ring showing the current cone | Valve labels its legacy dynamic crosshair "fake recoil, inaccurate feedback"; the split style separates the aim reference from the spread readout. |
| Mouse sensitivity | 0.003 rad per count | **shipped**: Source convention, 0.022 degrees per count, default sensitivity 1.5 (34.7 cm per 360 at 800 counts per inch) | A player can paste a number from another game. The single largest aim fix available. |
| Raw input | accumulated | raw relative motion, accumulation off, no acceleration, no smoothing | Matches the convention every competitive shooter uses. |
| Field of view | implicit 75 vertical (about 107 horizontal at 16:9) | Player-settings pass: explicit vertical setting, 60 to 110 degrees, default 75; wider monitors gain horizontal coverage and mouse turn rate stays unchanged | Menu units must match the camera contract. |
| Gamepad look | flat 2.2 radians per second | radial deadzone 10 percent, outer 95, exponent 2.0, 180 degrees per second cap, friction to 0.6x inside a 3 degree cone, no added magnetism | The hit cone is already magnetism, so the pad gets friction only. Deadzone and exponent are ours to tune; the platform defaults of 24 percent are unusable. |

## The triangle does not exist yet (2026-09-19)

Once the reflex agents were taught to hold the right weapon for the range, three seeded runs of six agents said this:

| Seed | Accuracy | Shots per kill | Time to kill p50 / p90 | Scatter shots / kills | Flechette shots / kills | Rail shots / kills |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 27.0% | 22.6 | 1.50 / 9.15 s | 912 / 36 | 262 / 16 | 0 / 0 |
| 7 | 18.5% | 32.0 | 1.50 / 6.80 s | 1172 / 38 | 234 / 6 | 0 / 0 |
| 42 | 36.6% | 17.0 | 1.50 / 3.95 s | 476 / 29 | 169 / 9 | 0 / 0 |

Three findings, all stable across seeds:

1. **The rail is never fired.** Not once, in any run. Fights never begin beyond thirty units because chasing agents close the distance first, so a hundred unit weapon has no situation. A weapon nobody can reach the range for is not a third corner of a triangle; it is dead weight on the pickup pads.
2. **Choosing the right weapon by range made the game worse, not better.** Against the earlier baseline, accuracy fell from 33.6 to 18.5 through 36.6 percent, and shots per kill roughly doubled to between 17 and 32. The scatter fires four times as fast for 15 damage with a wide cone, so a policy that favours it at close range produces a spray: more shots, fewer landing, longer fights.
3. **The median time to kill is 1.50 seconds in every run** while the ninetieth percentile swings from 3.95 to 9.15. The typical trade is consistent; the long tail is where the pacing problem lives, and it is the tail that makes a fight feel like it will not end.

This is the case for rung 2 in numbers rather than in taste: the weapon table needs the scatter to hit harder and slower, the rail to be reachable inside the arena, and the flechette to stop being the answer to every distance.

## After the weapon table and real dispersion (2026-09-19)

Same three seeds, six reflex agents, after rungs 2 and 3 landed together:

| Seed | Accuracy | Shots per kill | Time to kill p50 / p90 | Scatter shots / kills | Flechette | Rail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 16.5% | 22.0 | 1.30 / 5.45 s | 163 / 16 | 655 / 21 | 17 / 1 |
| 7 | 17.7% | 18.0 | 1.30 / 4.00 s | 205 / 17 | 504 / 21 | 30 / 3 |
| 42 | 15.3% | 22.6 | 0.90 / 7.60 s | 226 / 19 | 772 / 25 | 19 / 1 |

What moved, and what did not:

- **The median kill is faster and now lands at or near the target band**: 1.50 seconds before, 0.90 to 1.30 after, against a target of 0.6 to 1.2.
- **All three weapons are used.** The rail went from never firing in any seed to 17 to 30 shots and 1 to 3 kills. It is still a small share, because fights above eighteen units remain rare, but it has stopped being dead weight.
- **Accuracy fell from the high twenties and thirties to the mid teens, and that is the change working rather than a regression.** The old figure counted shots that landed because the target was inside a forgiveness cone; the new one counts shots that actually passed through a fighter. A number that drops when you remove free aim was measuring the free aim.
- **The numbers now hang together.** About 3.2 hits per kill at 16 percent accuracy over roughly twenty shots matches a table designed around four flechette hits or three scatter hits. Internal consistency of that kind is the cheapest evidence that a change did what it said.
- **The tail is still long**, four to seven and a half seconds at the ninetieth percentile. Some of that is the reflex agents holding the fire button through cover and across the map, which inflates the shot count; the planner tier and the movement work both have a claim on the rest.

Two changes had to land together, which is worth recording. Changing the cone values alone would have been meaningless while a cone meant forgiveness rather than dispersion, and fixing the meaning alone would have left the rail needing a tenth of a degree of accuracy to hit anything. The before and after therefore measures both.

## What the planner tier changed (2026-09-19)

Agents that hold the range their weapon wants, rather than charging, move the fight without changing the guns: kills at nought to five units fall from fifteen to nineteen per run to nought or one, the rail goes from one kill to as many as seven, and accuracy and shots per kill stay where they were. The full table is in `plans/agent-playtest-loop.md`.

The open question this left was firing discipline, and it has now been answered. Accuracy sat near fifteen percent whichever tier played, while a flechette at its ideal twelve units should land more than nine shots in ten. The cause was not dispersion: the agents had no way to know where the walls were, so they held the fire button through cover. The server now tells every joining fighter the arena's solids, and the reference agents check the line before firing.

| | Firing blind | Checking the line |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 15 to 17% | 54 to 64% |
| Shots per kill | 22 to 25 | 5.3 to 6.9 |
| Shots fired per run | 650 to 1570 | 234 to 348 |
| Time to kill p50 | 0.90 to 2.05 s | 1.05 to 1.65 s |

Giving agents the map changed their movement as well as their trigger, and the first attempt made them worse at one thing: an agent that could not see its target stood still, which the harness correctly flagged as stuck. Holding fire cannot mean standing there. Both policies now keep moving while blind, sliding left and right in turn so a pillar is something they go around rather than walk into, and the stuck threshold passes on every seed.

The weapon table is vindicated by the second column rather than the first. A kill needs three to four clean hits; at sixty percent accuracy that is about five point eight shots, and the measurement says five to six. Time to kill did not move, which is the control: the guns did not change, only what the agents chose to shoot at.

The lesson is worth keeping. For weeks of measurement the accuracy number was reporting the agents' ignorance of the map, not the weapons' dispersion, and any balance decision read off it would have been a decision about the wrong thing.

## Measuring it without human testers

The playtest harness already sees every shot: the server publishes a shot result per fire with hit or miss and the damage. Three additions make the weapon triangle and the time to kill measurable from agents alone, and they need no new wire data:

- Time to kill and shots to kill per victim, as a distribution with the interquartile range, by weapon.
- Accuracy by distance bucket with an interval on each rate, so a fighter with nine shots is not compared naively with one with nine hundred.
- Engagement distance histogram per weapon. The triangle works when each weapon's kills peak in its own band and the overlaps are small.

The rest lives in `benchmark-and-stats.md`. Restricted play is the cheapest balance test: the win rate of an agent forbidden one weapon against one that is not.

Input-to-photon latency needs a camera or a light sensor and stays a manual measurement; the research points at an open harness for it.

## Rungs

1. **Shipped.** Aim defaults: Source-convention sensitivity with a sane default, raw motion, and the setting documented in the units other games use.
2. **Shipped.** Weapon table: damage, interval, cone, range, and the scatter gun's falloff. Time to kill measured before and after, above. Switch time and the constants block a sweep would need are still to come.
3. **Shipped.** Dispersion separated from aim assist: a shot leaves the barrel somewhere inside the cone, drawn from the seeded stream, and lands only if it passes within a fighter's radius. Aim assistance is its own constant, zero for everyone until the gamepad work.
4. Movement inaccuracy and the recovery constant; the split crosshair that shows it.
5. Feedback: hit marker, muzzle flash, view kick, shake, bob, kill marker.
6. Ground dodge with its cooldown and recovery penalty, in the shared movement step with golden vectors.
7. Field of view and gamepad curves in settings, swept by the feel probes.

## Success criteria

- [x] Default sensitivity within the 30 to 50 centimetres per 360 band at 800 counts per inch, stored in portable units.
- [ ] Time to kill inside the target band, measured by the harness before and after. Table sticky assert: [`ttk-feel-harness-proof.md`](./ttk-feel-harness-proof.md).
- [ ] Each weapon's kill distances peak in its own band. All three are used now, but the rail is still only two to four percent of shots because long fights are rare.
- [x] Dispersion and aim assist are separate. A shot now has to pass within a fighter's radius; `AIM_ASSIST_RADIANS` is a single knob, zero for everyone, waiting for the gamepad work to give it a reason.
- [ ] Every feedback timing implemented and visible in a tour still.
- [ ] The dodge exists, is in the golden vectors, and the playtests prefer it.
