# The Higgsfield art pipeline

How fragr makes pictures. `tools/spritegen` is the program, `docs/ART-GENERATION-SPEC.md` is the contract it executes, and this file is what was measured against the live API so the next run does not have to rediscover it.

Higgsfield is the existing image provider; ElevenLabs is the existing audio provider.
Code-native surfaces and effects also belong in the game. Paid calls never run in
CI or at player runtime; the tools' offline tests do run in CI.

## What the API actually is

Historical account observations from the initial art runs. Recheck the current
model schema, pricing, quota, and billing terms before spending. These are not
guarantees for every model or account. Request recovery was checked against the
official sources linked in [asset-request-recovery.md](asset-request-recovery.md)
on 2026-09-19.

- Base is `https://api.higgsfield.ai`. Authentication is a single header, `Authorization: Key <id>:<secret>`, and `.env` holds the whole pair on one `higgsfield=` line because that is exactly the string the header wants.
- Submission returns a `request_id` and a `status_url`. Poll it until `completed`, `failed`, `nsfw` or `canceled`, starting at two seconds and backing off to ten.
- `POST /estimate/<model-id>` prices any request for nothing. This is the budget gate and the reason the tool can refuse a run as a whole instead of discovering the bill halfway through.
- The provider documents refunds for some failed or cancelled requests. The local
  ledger cannot verify a refund, so it retains the reservation until reconciled.
- Output URLs live for at least seven days and then may vanish, so the tool downloads every frame rather than storing links.
- Concurrency is about four in flight and exceeding it returns **HTTP 400**, not 429. There are no rate-limit headers and no `Retry-After`.
- `image_urls` accepts up to sixteen reference images. This is the single most valuable field in the API for a game: once one weapon is approved it becomes the style board for the rest of the armoury, which is how thousands of frames stay on-model.

## What things cost

Measured, per image, through the estimate endpoint on 2026-09-19.

| Model | Parameters | Cost | What it is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `marketing-studio/image` | `low` / 2k | $0.019 | Exploration. The workhorse |
| `marketing-studio/image` | `medium` / 2k | $0.100 | Promoting a keeper |
| `marketing-studio/image` | `high` / 2k | $0.373 | Rarely worth it |
| `higgsfield-ai/soul/v2/standard` | 720p | $0.004 | Photoreal people. Cheapest thing here |
| `higgsfield-ai/soul/v2/standard` | 1080p | $0.006 | Photoreal people |
| `recraft/v4.1/pro/text-to-image` | 2k png | $0.210 | Has real palette and background-colour fields |
| `higgsfield-ai/soul/standard` | v1 | $0.094 | Superseded. Fifteen times the price of v2 for no gain |

The shape of the spend follows from that table: **explore wide at two cents and promote only keepers at ten**. Generating everything at `high` costs twenty times as much and, as the next section shows, does not buy a better sprite.

`marketing-studio/image` is the model for props and weapons. It honours a transparent background, which nothing else here reliably does, and it generates isolated objects rather than scenes.

## The finding that decides the house style

The obvious plan was the Boltgun plan: render something detailed and shrink it, which is how Boltgun, Prodeus and Doom itself made their sprites. It is wrong for us, and it was cheap to prove.

Eight frames were generated, the same four subjects asked for twice: once as `retro pixel art sprite, 1990s PC shooter, limited palette`, and once as `high detail 3D rendered game weapon prop`. Both sets were then reduced to the same 180-pixel sprite height by the same code.

The rendered set collapsed into mud. The stylised set survived and came out crisp.

The reason is value contrast, not resolution. A model asked for a photoreal prop lights it photographically: olive on olive, a narrow band of middle values, detail carried by subtle shading that does not exist any more once the sprite is 180 pixels tall. A model asked for a limited palette returns high value separation, and value separation is the only thing that survives a large downscale.

Boltgun's pipeline works because human artists control the contrast and palette of the render. A prompt cannot control that tightly enough. So fragr asks the generator for the end state and enforces the rest locally.

**Ask for the stylised sprite. Quantise it against `docs/palette.json`. Never ask for a photoreal render and shrink it.**

The corollary matters too: reduction without palette quantisation produces mush from either arm. The palette step is not a finishing touch, it is what makes the sprite a sprite.

## The other half: reduction

`tools/spritegen reduce` is local, free, and does four things in an order that is not arbitrary.

1. **Trim to the alpha bounding box.** A generator centres its subject in whatever canvas it likes; trimming first means the downscale ratio is set by the sprite rather than by the empty space around it.
2. **Downscale by area averaging**, so every source pixel contributes to exactly one output pixel. Nearest-neighbour here would throw away most of what was paid for.
3. **Quantise to the palette in CIE L\*a\*b\***, not RGB. RGB distance picks visibly wrong swatches in dark and saturated regions; Lab picks the one an eye would call nearest.
4. **Harden the alpha.** A sprite has no half-transparent edge. Everything goes fully on or fully off, which is what gives a silhouette its bite.

## How the money is kept under control

The same explicit approval discipline applies to image, audio, and decision-model calls.

- **The whole run is priced before anything is generated.** If the total exceeds the cap, nothing is generated at all.
- **`--max-spend-usd` is required for a live run and is itself capped** at `HARD_CAP_USD`, five dollars. A run that needs more than that should be split and approved a piece at a time.
- **A locked, synced request ledger** sits beside the output. A reservation is
  written before submission, followed by the returned status URL, completed URLs,
  and downloaded filenames. Rerunning polls an existing request and refreshes its
  download links. It never automatically buys a replacement for that frame ID.

The cap applies to estimated new submissions in that invocation, not confirmed
billing or a shared account balance. Reconcile earlier reservations and verify
remaining credit before a new paid batch; preserve the repository's overall $50
approval limit. No automatic refund, overage, or account-quota assumption is made.

### Interrupted requests

Rerun the same `gen` command with the same spec and cap. Known request IDs resume
without another generation POST. Completed historical rows remain readable, but
their old format has no model/request identity. Missing recorded files must be
restored; they do not authorize regeneration.

If submission may have reached the provider but no status URL was saved, the run
stops. Match the frame and its recorded request to the provider dashboard, then
attach the verified request ID locally:

```bash
cargo run -p fragr-spritegen --locked -- recover --out art/raw/weapons-bakeoff --frame-id px_tack_issued --request-id VERIFIED_REQUEST_ID
```

`recover` needs no key and sends no network request. It only advances an uncertain
reservation. Then rerun `gen`. If no matching request can be established, leave
the reservation intact and reconcile it before explicitly approving a new frame
ID. Do not delete receipts to make a run proceed.

Older interrupted runs may have no receipt at all. Reconcile their provider
history before reusing a spec; the new ledger cannot reconstruct unrecorded calls.

Changed requests under an existing ID, corrupt or unfinished records, conflicting
filename case, and competing writers stop the run. Preserve the ledger with the
raw outputs and back it up. A process interruption is covered; local file syncing
is not a guarantee against disk failure or every network-filesystem lock model.

## Using it

```
# Free. Assembles and prints the prompts, sends nothing.
cargo run -p fragr-spritegen -- prompts --spec tools/spritegen/specs/weapons-viewmodel-bakeoff.json

# Free. Prices the run against the live estimate endpoint.
cargo run -p fragr-spritegen -- price --spec tools/spritegen/specs/weapons-viewmodel-bakeoff.json

# Spends money. Refuses without a cap, and refuses if the priced run exceeds it.
cargo run -p fragr-spritegen -- gen --spec tools/spritegen/specs/weapons-viewmodel-bakeoff.json --max-spend-usd 0.30

# Free, local, no network.
cargo run -p fragr-spritegen -- reduce --input art/raw/weapons-bakeoff --out art/sprites/weapons \
  --height 180 --palette docs/palette.json --preview-scale 4
```

`art/raw/` is gitignored because provider output is large. Keep a backup of its
receipts and keepers; regeneration costs money and may produce different art.
Reduced sprites and their reviewed provenance are committed.

## The palette

`docs/palette.json` already existed, as a named map of RGBA arrays, and the tool reads that format rather than asking the project to adopt a new one. It also accepts hex strings and a wrapping `colours` key, so a future palette can be written either way.

Quantising the bake-off against the real palette is a visible improvement over quantising it against an invented one: the gunmetal ramp carries the weapon body and the rust accents get to do all the work, which is the rule of grey in `ART-COLOR.md` behaving exactly as advertised.

It also surfaced a real gap. The palette has ink, bone, three gunmetals, rust, blood, two embers, two cyans, two magentas and the on-air red. It has **no institutional green**, which is the colour the Continuance's issued hardware wants to be, and no off-white for the unmarked machines of the thing in the dark. Those are two faction ramps the palette does not yet carry. Adding them is a colour decision rather than a tooling one, so it belongs in `ART-COLOR.md` and to whoever owns the look, not to this tool quietly appending swatches.

## What is not done yet

- **Reference preparation and consistent animation.** `params.image_urls` already
  passes through the spec into the request and receipt. Local-file upload,
  reference ownership/lifetime checks, and a proven multi-frame workflow remain.
  Verify the chosen model's current field limits before preparing a batch.
- **Normal maps.** The contract in `ART-GENERATION-SPEC.md` asks for a normal beside every albedo, derived from a depth pass. Nothing generates one.
- **Animation.** Per-frame animation is where generated art is weakest. The image-to-video models on this same key are a real route to a sprite sheet: generate a still, animate it, extract frames. Untested.
- **Concurrency.** The tool submits one frame at a time. The account allows about four, so a large run is currently four times slower than it needs to be.
