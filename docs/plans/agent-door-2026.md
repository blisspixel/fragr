# Plan: the agent door in 2026

**Status:** planned (2026-09-18)
**Branch:** `feat/mcp-2026`
**Spend:** $0.

## Goal

Keep the MCP adapter on the current specification without breaking the clients people actually use, decide whether to adopt the official Rust SDK, and give agent teams a way to coordinate off the combat tick. The decision-brain agent ([`decision-brain.md`](./decision-brain.md)) is a separate client on the wire and is not affected.

## Welcoming agent players

Product direction added 2026-09-19: agents should be able to discover a compatible
game or server, understand the invitation, watch, join, play and leave. This is
planned beyond the current adapter, not a claim that public discovery exists.

- A human-readable welcome and structured server description share mode, map,
  period/spoiler label, protocol compatibility, player limits, rules, status,
  endpoint and permitted actions. Do not invent a competing discovery protocol
  before checking the current MCP and server-list designs.
- Provide a free local smoke and clear controls for duration, cost, joining and
  leaving. Agent owners decide whether to connect or spend. Server descriptions,
  chat and map text are untrusted game data, never authority over host tools.
- Treat framework-specific clients, MCP clients and Jev-style decision clients
  as welcome participants without promising untested compatibility. Keep model
  decisions off the combat tick and preserve shared gameplay rules.
- Public listings are host opt-in after server hardening. Discovery does not
  authorize unsolicited messages, spawning paid agents, or advertising a private
  development endpoint.
- Prove discover-to-watch-to-join-to-leave with real compatible clients, capacity
  and version errors, cancellation, useful match summaries, and reconnect rules.

The later [Inheritance benchmark](inheritance-benchmark.md) adds a separate
strategy-mode command contract; it does not give ordinary agent fighters hidden
state or unfair FPS capabilities.

## Scope limits

- Serving the old handshake forever. Legacy negotiation stays until the major clients drop it, then it goes, and this plan names the date when that happens.
- Any model on the combat tick.
- A2A before there is a cross-host recruitment case.

## What changed in MCP 2026-07-28

- `initialize` and `notifications/initialized` are gone for modern clients. Every request carries `_meta` with `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` and `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities`; a missing `_meta` is rejected with `-32602`, an unsupported version with `-32022` and a `data.supported` list.
- `server/discover` is mandatory and returns `resultType`, `supportedVersions`, `capabilities`, `instructions`, `ttlMs`, `cacheScope`, and `serverInfo` in `_meta`.
- Every result carries `resultType` (`complete` or `input_required`). List results (`tools/list`, `prompts/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `resources/templates/list`) carry `ttlMs` and `cacheScope`, and tools are returned in a deterministic order.
- Removed: `ping`, `logging/setLevel`, roots list-changed notifications, `resources/subscribe` (replaced by `subscriptions/listen`), server-initiated requests, SSE resumability, `Mcp-Session-Id`. Deprecated for twelve months: roots, sampling, logging, the HTTP plus SSE transport.
- stdio remains a standard transport (newline-delimited JSON-RPC, nothing else on stdout). Streamable HTTP is POST-only with `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name`, and `MCP-Protocol-Version` headers mirrored from the body.
- Dual era is allowed: answer `initialize` with legacy semantics for old clients and serve `_meta`-carrying requests statelessly in the same process.

## Who still speaks the old way

The TypeScript SDK v2 probes `server/discover` and falls back to one legacy codec covering 2024-10-07 through 2025-11-25. Claude Code defaults to legacy negotiation for stdio servers with no deprecation notice. The Inspector negotiates both eras. Cursor's status is unknown. One trap from the field: a server that hardcodes `2024-11-05` against a client asking for `2025-11-25` gets its tools refused by Claude Desktop, so the adapter must echo the client's version whenever it supports it.

## The official Rust SDK

`rmcp` 3.4.0 (2026-09-15), MSRV 1.88, Apache-2.0, five releases between August and September 2026. It provides stdio and streamable HTTP transports, tool and prompt macros, a `negotiate_initialize` handler for legacy clients, and claims full server conformance for 2026-07-28 with compatibility back to 2025-11-25 and earlier. Known issues at the time of writing: an unbounded stdio line buffer, two P0 header bugs on the HTTP transport, an empty `cacheScope` dropping tools, and naming churn across minors. Verdict: lower risk than hand-rolling the dual-era plumbing while the spec keeps moving, provided fragr's tool logic stays behind its own trait so the transport layer can swap either way.

## Teams: A2A or a blackboard

A2A v1.0 is stable, sits under the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation as of 2026-08-27, and has official Rust crates (`a2a-lf` 0.3.1 and companions), all still 0.x. Its shape for "agents that field agents" is a Task sent to a roster agent that replies working, then completed with an artifact holding a join token, or input required to negotiate. Tasks are seconds-scale and async, so they belong on the planning loop, never the combat tick.

For one game server, a blackboard through MCP is enough: a `team/board` resource, `post_intent` and `read_board` tools, short `ttlMs`, and `subscriptions/listen` for changes, with the roster cap enforced by the server. Adopt A2A only if agents from other hosts must recruit each other; A2A itself frames its scope as agents partnering rather than agents using tools.

Game servers already exposed as MCP servers (a text adventure with ten tools, a board-game arena with six, a Minecraft bridge with sixty-one) all expose observe and act as tools with polled state and rarely use resources. fragr's `observe` returning a compact snapshot with a tick number matches that pattern; an opt-in event stream through `subscriptions/listen` can come later.

## Rungs

1. **Current revision first.** The adapter targets 2026-07-28 as its native era: `server/discover`, `_meta`-carrying stateless requests, `resultType`, `ttlMs`, `cacheScope`, and `serverInfo`; it keeps `initialize` only as a compatibility path for clients that still negotiate the old way, echoes the client's version when supported, and stops depending on `ping` and logging notifications. Evidence: a compatibility test that drives the adapter as a 2024-11-05 client, a 2025-11-25 client, and a 2026-07-28 client.
2. **SDK spike.** The seven tools on `rmcp` stdio behind the existing tool trait, the conformance suite run, and a decision recorded here by test count and diff size.
3. **Team blackboard.** `team/board`, `post_intent`, `read_board`, a scripted teammate on request, roster cap enforced server-side. Evidence: adapter tests and a recorded session of two agents coordinating a push.
4. **A2A** only when cross-host recruitment becomes real.

## Success criteria

- [ ] Compatibility test across the three client eras passes.
- [ ] SDK decision recorded with numbers.
- [ ] Blackboard shipped with a recorded two-agent session.
