# Transport and Networking

## Current: WebSocket JSON (Slice 1)

**Status:** Implemented
**Use case:** Loopback, agent play, spectator streams and current human play

### Details
- Protocol: WebSocket over TCP
- Format: JSON text messages
- Address: Server binds `0.0.0.0:6767` by default (loopback, LAN, or public host)
- Client: Loopback default, accepts `FRAGR_SERVER` env var for remote connections
- Tick rate: ~20 Hz server broadcast
- Multi-peer: Multiple spectators/players can connect to same match
- Pros: Simple, universal, easy to debug, works for all roles, multi-peer ready
- Cons: Ordered TCP delivery can stall newer updates after loss; JSON uses more bytes than a compact binary format

**Current playable path.** Spectators and agents share this transport with humans. Competitive human feel is not yet established by a two-machine or unsteered human session. The [loopback Action-to-Ack measurement](plans/human-action-ack-baseline.md) samples only server-selected Actions, so it is not a general input-latency result. A second peer can spectate the same match over LAN or a public host.

## Planned: measured UDP pilot

**Status:** Planned after the human Action-to-Ack baseline and live prediction measurement
**Use case:** Low-latency human FPS play, competitive matches

### Why test UDP?

For smooth human FPS, sub-50ms input latency is ideal. WebSocket over TCP has:
- TCP head-of-line blocking (one dropped packet stalls the stream)
- JSON serialization overhead
- Larger packet sizes

UDP with custom protocol (e.g., `renet`, `laminar`, or hand-rolled) provides:
- Unreliable + reliable channels (input on unreliable, events on reliable)
- Binary serialization (smaller packets)
- No head-of-line blocking
- Client-side prediction + server reconciliation

### Planned Architecture

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Godot Client (Human)                    │
│  • UDP for actions (unreliable)          │

### Godot ↔ Rust UDP Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `renet` | Battle-tested, channels, reliable + unreliable | Rust-first; Godot needs custom GDScript wrapper |
| `laminar` | Rust + clean API | Less mature, GDScript integration unclear |
| Custom UDP | Full control, tailored to fragr | More work, reinvent reliability layer |
| GDExtension | Native Rust in Godot | Build complexity, cross-platform pain |

**Recommendation:** the spike of record is stage 7 of `plans/buttery-controls.md`: candidate A is a 12-byte sequence, ack, and ack-bits header over `PacketPeerUDP` and `tokio::net::UdpSocket`; candidate B is ENet; the decision is made against the pass thresholds in that plan. `renet` is a fallback, not the default. WebTransport is not available in Godot 4.7.

Prediction and reconciliation do not wait for UDP. The [human Action-to-Ack baseline](plans/human-action-ack-baseline.md) measures the WebSocket path; its send-to-ack interval is neither RTT nor a prediction-correction metric. The [live step](plans/live-movement-step.md) and [3D movement Ack](plans/movement-ack-v1.md) prepare replay on that same wire. The transport spike follows live prediction and a two-machine LAN comparison.

## Timeline

- **Now:** WebSocket JSON for everyone.
- **Buttery-controls stages 1 to 6:** client-owned yaw, prediction, interpolation, 60 Hz sim, lag compensation, still on WebSocket.
- **Buttery-controls stage 7:** the measured UDP spike; on a pass, humans move to UDP while spectators and agents stay on WebSocket.
